# Details

These three datasets are not connected with software engineering tasks, instead they optimize for a car performance in the case of auto93, the quality of a wine in Wine Quality and different performance metrics for cars on Car price cleaned . They serve as debug purposes. While all other datasets require some specialized SE domain knowledge. These two allow SE newcomers to apply their general knowledge while implementing and fixing their algorithms.


## Car_price_cleaned Dataset
- **Rows**: 205 vehicle records
- **X columns**: 38 features (car specifications, dimensions, engine details, performance metrics)
- **Y columns**: 5 (FUELTYPE-, ASPIRATION+, DOORNUMBER+, PRICE+, DRIVEWHEEL+)
- **Description**: Automotive dataset for car price prediction and feature analysis. Contains vehicle specifications (dimensions, weight, body type), engine characteristics (size, cylinders, compression ratio), performance metrics (horsepower, peak RPM, fuel economy), brand information, and derived features (power-to-weight ratio, squared measurements) to predict and optimize fuel type, aspiration, door configuration, drive wheel setup, and ultimately, vehicle pricing.
